        beside her name which also eventually revealed why the young girl was there in the first place. The young girl's resilient and kindness was able to get through

        Enjel was not the young girl's name. Enjel, however, had a secret. Enjel was created by the strange boy who was actually a demon. The young girl's mother made a pact with the demon
        to gain a better life-- Rich, money, status, etc. In return, the mother must give the young girl's name to him which means the life she was supposed the receive--A life bathed in gold (Happiness).
        The young girl's mother regretted the decision and decided to retaliate which caused her life and the young girl's family. Before that, the mother created the pocket mirror to remind the young girl of
        her name. Despite Enjel tried to help and guide the young girl, she had an ulterior motive by stealing her pocket mirror to take on her identity but failed and shattered in regret and pain.

        Her name was Goldia die Heilige and was admitted to an asylum or mental hospital for lunacy, dissociation (multiple personality), and
        dementia praecox (schizophrenia). Finally understanding who she was and accepting her other selves who represented the spoiled and hysteric personality (Fleta),
        how she decided to turn a blind eye to how mentally ill she was (Harpae), and of course, her own violence and frustration (Lisette). Each encounter were merely a facade of
        her dissociation that was given a fleeting form when Goldia was in coma.
